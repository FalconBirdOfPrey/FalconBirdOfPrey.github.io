    <h1> You have come to the right place, here is where I display various personal projects!</h1>
        <div class="bluebg">
            <h2 class="bluebg"> This, the first one, is a manuscript written in Swedish, of a book which is more of a novella than a novel. Chapters are at the bottom of the page. 
                <p>On the surface a story about industrial espionage as a consequence of incompetent, destructive and dangerous leadership. Acutely relevant in today's society.</p></h2> 
                <h2> So how much of all this is actually true, and in what way? A lot I would say, maybe all considering how crazy the world has become. But let's focus on the technology, the technical system at the core of this story.
                     <p>Putin's murderous regime (The man himself was head of FSB at the time) did in fact order the telecommunication system, used for tracking and killing people, described in this publication.</p>
                     <p>The supplier was a Swedish telecommunications group quite renowned for its dirty business. 
                        The usage described in the book likely reflects the reality.</p> 
                    <p style="color:black";><q>We are following the laws of the countries we're exporting to.</q></p> 
                    <i>(Quote by their head of security at the time).</i> 
                </h2>
                <h2 class="bluebg">The description of the Governmental agency's handling of the matter, aimed at certain Swedish citizens, is likely accurate. The key takeaway is that the Swedish Security Police (SÄPO) prioritized the protection of this export. Thereby aiding war crimes.
                    <p>They then went to great lengths to cover up their horrendous self-goal, at the expense of individuals whom they are obliged to protect but instead tried to silence and discredit in despicable ways. 
                    For the sake of their own reputation, and others'. Beacons of society who weren't particularly eager to take on responsibility.</p> 
                    <p>What (probably) started as a mistake due to lack of understanding regressed into deliberate abuse. 
                        Furthermore, the knowledge about methods used by the Russian regime against its own people was swept under the rug.</p> 
                        <p>A chance to inform the world about Vladimir Putin, his mentality and actions, was thereby omitted. 
                        More than two decades ago. That's the reason this important and necessary book was ever written.</p><p style="color:black";> As the little man in Kreml waved his big guns, eradicating all doubts; these people forever found themselves on the wrong side of history.</p></h2>
