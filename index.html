    <h1 class="blood"> You have come to the right place, here is where I display various personal projects!</h1>
        <div class="bluebg">
            <h2 class="bluebg"> This, the first one, is a manuscript written in Swedish, of a book which is more of a novella than a novel. Chapters are at the bottom of the page. 
                <p>On the surface a story about industrial espionage as a consequence of incompetent, destructive and dangerous leadership. Acutely relevant in today's society.</p></h2> 
                <h2> So how much of all this is actually true, and in what way? A lot I would say, maybe all considering how crazy the world has become. But let's focus on the technology, the telephone exchange software at the core. 
                     <p>Putin's murderous regime (The man himself was head of FSB at the time) did in fact place the order, so brightly elucidated in this literary gem, used for tracking and killing people.</p>  
            </h2><h2 class="bluebg">The order was placed before the Ryazan incident and the prior false flag bombings, which led up to an already planned war. 
                         Food for thought inasmuch as the usage described likely reflects the reality. 
                     <p>The supplier was a Swedish telecommunications group -since the turn of the millennia quite renowned, internationally, for its dirty business.</p> 
                    <p style="color:black";><q>We are following the laws of the countries we're exporting to.</q></p> 
                    <i>(Quote by their head of security at the time).</i> 
                </h2>
                <h2>The description of the Governmental agency's handling of the matter, aimed at certain Swedish citizens, is likely accurate.
                    <p>The key takeaway is that SÄPO, the Swedish Security Police, prioritized the protection of this export. Thereby aiding war crimes, and by extension crimes against humanity and maybe even genocide.
                    <p>What might have started as an instance of obtuse thinking to put it mildly, soon regressed into nothing less than deliberate abuse of power.</h2>
            <h2 class="bluebg">The priority shifted towards silencing people, as the reputation of Company and Country was Considered Paramount, 
                        in it's worst Marxist-Leninist fashion.</p>   
                        <p>Furthermore, the knowledge of what the Russian regime did against its own people, was swept under the rug.</p> 
                        <p>A chance to inform the world about Vladimir Putin, his devilish mentality and actions, was thereby omitted. 
                        More than two decades ago, and a month before he was elected president on the 26th March of 2000.</p>
            <p>There are some of the reasons this important and necessary book was ever written.</p><p style="color:black";> As the little man in Kreml waved his big guns, eradicating all doubts; these people forever found themselves on the wrong side of history.</p></h2>
