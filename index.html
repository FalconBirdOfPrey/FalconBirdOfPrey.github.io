    <h1 class="blood">My account of a sequence of events leading up to the manuscript (in Swedish) that follows.</h1>
        <div class="bluebg">
            <h2 class="bluebg">On the surface a story about industrial espionage as a consequence of incompetent, destructive and dangerous leadership. And here I could quote "The Matrix", 
                writing something scornful about blue pills and "believe whatever...", but I wouldn't blame you so I'll skip that. Sometimes, ignorance is bliss afterall.</h2> 
                <h2>Instead I'm going to focus on the technology, the telephone exchange software at the core. 
                    Events that started many years ago, with dark tentacles stretching into the present and the future. 
                     <p>What initially, by all standards, looked like an innocuous order, was in 1997 placed by Putin's murderous regime (The man himself was head of FSB at the time). 
                         Since this order was well masked no suspicion was initially raised, but that changed pretty quickly when it turned out that the product ordered, so brightly elucidated in this literary gem, was going to be used for tracking and extermination. Of human beings.</p>  
            </h2><h2 class="bluebg">The order was placed before the Ryazan incident and the prior, according to several independent sources, false flag bombings, 
            which is a quite interesting fact since those so called "terrorist attacks" had a couple of important consequences. 
            <p>The first outcome was that a reason for starting a war against the "terrorists" now had materialized, the second -a sudden massive support for FSB's candidate for the Russian presidency. 
            In conjunction with other indications an even clearer picture thereby emerged out of the mist.</p>
            <p>To clarify, FSB ordered and had technical equipment (an early voice recognition system of sorts) installed in Chechnya, whether it was fully functional or not doesn't matter - what's of essence here is the timing, to be used in a genocidal war. 
                This computer software became part of an infrastructure that was built before the reason to start that war emerged. 
                The conclusion can only be one -Vladimir Putin replicated the works of Adolf Hitler in blaming others.</p>
                     <p>The supplier of this product was a Swedish telecommunications group -since the turn of the millennia quite renowned, internationally, for its dirty business.</p> 
                    <p style="color:black";><q>We are following the laws of the countries we're exporting to.</q></p> 
                    <i>(Quote by their head of security at the time, agitated from answering questions pertaining to the legality of this specific matter. It was clear that he was talking about Russian law.)</i> 
                </h2>
                <h2>The description of the Governmental agency's scandalous handling of the affair, aimed at certain Swedish citizens, is to a very large extent likely accurate.
                    <p>The key takeaway is that SÄPO, the Swedish Security Police, prioritized the protection of this export.
                        Even though they almost certainly had no idea what they were supporting, they were unknowingly aiding war crimes, and by extension crimes against humanity and maybe even genocide.
                    <p>And here comes the interesting part. As they were enlighted of the situation, by me and no one else, their behaviour regressed into a deliberate and remarkable display of abuse of power.</h2>
            <h2 class="bluebg">Their priority shifted towards silencing people, as the reputation of company and country was considered paramount according to what we in Sweden call "demokratisk värdegrund" (not really sure if I was being ironic there or not).</p>   
                        <p>Furthermore, the knowledge of what the Russian regime did against its own people, i.e. the false flag bombings mentioned above, was swept under the rug.
            There are indications that this hold was undersold, to say the least, to the Russian government in that a rescuing convoy from EU and UN was let in to Chechnya less than a week afterwards.</p> 
            <p>If so, that was probably one of the worst decisions ever. Depending on how the current Ukrainian-European-World situation pans out, maybe the worst and saddest in the history of human civilization.</p> 
                        <p>A chance to expose the world and the russian voters to the real Vladimir Putin, his clearly devilish mentality and actions as well as the underlying structures represented by him, was thereby omitted. 
                        More than two decades ago, and a month before he was elected president on March 26th 2000.</p>
            <p style="color:black";> As the little man in Kreml waved his big guns, eradicating all doubts; these people forever found themselves on the wrong side of history, in shame and eternal infamy.</p></h2>
