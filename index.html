    <h1>This is where I display various personal projects!</h1>
        <div>
            <h2> This first project is a manuscript, written in Swedish, of a book which is more of a novella than a novel. 
                On the surface it's about industrial espionage and crappy leadership, something that is definitely relevant in today's society. 
                Although the story is rooted in reality, it is to be read as a fictional story.</h2> 
                <h2>I'm interested in selling my artistic work: print rights (paperback or hard copy), digital eBook rights, audiobook rights, 
                    movie rights, translation rights, foreign rights, television adaptation rights, large print edition rights, 
                    book club rights and other rights. I am also interested in cooperating with others to perhaps help make the novella grow to a fully fledged novel. 
                    Finder's fee might be applicable. All work is under exclusive copyright by default!</h2>
